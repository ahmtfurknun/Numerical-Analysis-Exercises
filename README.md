# Numerical-Analysis-Exercises

The course gives an introduction to numerical analysis. The main
topics covered are: elements of numerical linear algebra, iterative solution
of nonlinear algebraic equations and local and global polynomial approximation of functions. The course will contain description and heuristic derivation of algorithms but
also theoretical aspects of these with proofs when they are accessible with the required
background knowledge.

The purpose of the course is to give an introduction to selected modern topics in numerical analysis. Upon completion of the course the students will have a basic understanding of various numerical methods; both theory and practice. The students will be able to write a computer code for the algorithms they study and solve practical problems with them.
